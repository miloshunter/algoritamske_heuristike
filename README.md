# Algorithm Heuristics

## A* maze search
The problem of maze search is solved using 3 different algorithm:

	-	Breadth first search
	
	-	Greedy Best first search
	
	-	A* (A star) search
The simulation is drawn and one can see the algorithm working realtime
	
## Genetic algorithms
### Implementation of Genetic Altorithm for function minimization
Custom length-bit string representation of a float number

For mutation flipping of random bit is used

For crossover two bitstrings are split and mixed at random point
### 3-SAT functions that can be solved with Matlab's optimtool
Equation:

Can be interpreted as:

And by using matlabs GA solver from optimtool, we can find solution to the problem.

## Artificial neural network
### NeuralNetwork toolbox
Using the Matlab's NeuralNetwork toolbox, 4 parity function is implemented

Also custom function is implemented, including the Simulink model of a trained network:

## Cellular automata (WireWorld)
In WireWorld cellular automata, custom digital circuit is implemented:

The file opens in Golly application for cellular automata simulation

## Partitioning of a digital circuit
Partition is done both with Kernighan Lin algorithm and Simulated Annealing
